# Rock, Paper, Scissors
Written in Python, using modulo arithmetic. The game can be played by 1 or 2 players. The score is
incremented by 1 whenever there is a win, and stays the same when there is a tie. When the game is
complete, the user(s) are asked if they want to play again, and the program will exit or continue
depending on input. More features may be added in the future such as an option to choose between
"Rock, Paper, Scissors" and "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock".
